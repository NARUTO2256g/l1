    anime world
    <p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ; IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ;[a] derived from a shortening of the English word animation) is hand-drawn and
    computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to
    animation produced in Japan.[1] However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of
    style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan.
    Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that may be labelled as anime.</p>
